# TodoEr - Your Ultimate TODO Helper

<!-- Plugin description -->
**TodoEr** is a plugin for JetBrains-based IDEs that highlights all commented `TODOs` in the project source code.

As a developer, I often forget to fix my `TODO`s and end up pushing code for review with unfinished tasks. This can be frustrating and unprofessional. That's why I created TodoEr, a helper tool to ensure `TODO`s are visible and easily tracked before the code review. I hope it helps you too!
